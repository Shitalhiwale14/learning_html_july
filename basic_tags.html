    <pre>Dagadusheth Halwai was a successful sweet seller (Halwai) and a rich businesss                               in the city of Pune in the late 1800s. His original halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets"                                                                      near Datta Mandir in Pune.In the late 1800s, he and his wife Laxmibai lost their only son in a plague epidemic. The grieving couple followed the advice of a sage to build a Ganesh temple                                           in Pune in his memory.[5] Later, Dagdusheth adopted, his nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) who was 9 years old                                               at the time of his death. Govindsheth replaced the first Ganesh idol by a new one, with the first one still being present at Akra Maruti Chowk
